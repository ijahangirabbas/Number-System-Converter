# Number-System-Converter
This is my first C project as a bachelor's student. It converts numbers between Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal, including fractional values. The program uses input validation, clean logic, and menu-based navigation to provide accurate and user-friendly number system conversions.
