# Number-System-Converter
This number system converter project was built as a team effort by a group of beginner-level C programming students. Each member focused on implementing a key part of the program to ensure it covered various conversion scenarios and handled fractional values accurately.

Muhammad Ammar Qaisar developed the function responsible for converting Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal numbers into their Decimal equivalents. His work ensured that both integer and fractional parts were properly processed and returned with precision.

Jahangir Abbas contributed by implementing the logic for converting Decimal numbers into Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal formats. His function also supported fractional conversions using repeated multiplication and accurate rounding.

Ahsan handled the core function that converts between non-decimal systemsâ€”for example, Binary to Hexadecimal, Octal to Binary, and Hexadecimal to Octal. His function included input validation, fractional handling, and neatly formatted output.

Together, their combined efforts resulted in a complete and user-friendly number system converter that runs in the command-line interface and supports two-way conversions with fractional support.
